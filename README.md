## Objective
To gain practical, hands-on experience in using Lima Charlie, a cloud-based security platform, to manage security operations, improve incident response capabilities, and enhance organizational security posture in real-time.

### Skills Learned
- Telemetry Management and Data Analysis
  - Collecting, ingesting, and analyzing telemetry data from multiple sources.
  - Centralizing data to correlate security events across a wide range of assets.
  - Leveraging real-time feeds and timelines for proactive monitoring and decision-making.
- Incident Response
  - Deploying sleeper agents for rapid telemetry collection.
  - Responding to security incidents with minimal setup, ensuring quick deployment.
  - Isolating and quarantining compromised systems to prevent further breaches.  
- Security Tool Integration
  - Integrating Lima Charlie with third-party tools (e.g., VirusTotal) for enhanced functionality.   
- Real-Time Security Operations
  - Monitoring security incidents in real-time for faster response and mitigation.
  - Using Lima Charlieâ€™s interface to manage incidents, track events, and execute containment procedures quickly.

### Tools Used
- Lima Charlie Platform:
  - Sleeper agents for telemetry collection.
  - User interface for managing security operations and sensors.
  - Real-time feeds and timelines for ongoing event monitoring.
- Third-Party Integrations:
  - VirusTotal for virus/malware analysis.
